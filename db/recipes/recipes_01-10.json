(Note: The chicken is not cooked through yet; it’ll finish cooking in the soup.)",

Sauté until the onions are slightly tender and golden, about 2 minutes (if the pot begins to get dry, add the remaining teaspoon of olive oil).",
      "Return the chicken to the pot, pouring in any juices from the dish. Add the water and parsley to the pot. Increase heat to high. Once the soup begins to boil, reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for 20 minutes. Add the pasta to the soup and cook for 15 to 20 minutes more, until the pasta is as tender as you like it.",

Save the meat from the remaining thighs to use in another recipe later in the week (it’s a great add-in for the Vietnamese Rice Noodle Salad, the Kale & Almond Fried Rice, or your favorite chicken salad recipe).",
      "Stir the shredded chicken into the pot. Ladle the soup into deep bowls, and serve hot. \nVariation:  Without the noodles, this makes a wonderful bone broth for use in other recipes. *GLUTEN-FREE IF YOU USE GLUTEN-FREE NOODLES"

      "4. When the spinach mixture has cooled enough that it won't scramble the eggs, mix the two together thoroughly in the mixing bowl.",
      "5. Unwrap and unroll your phyllo pastry.  Cover it with a damp towel to prevent it drying out and cracking while you work.",
      "6. Butter the bottom of a rectangular baking dish, then lay on one sheet of phyllo.  Butter the sheet (using a pastry brush is the easiest way to do this) and lay down another.  Continue until you have 8 to 10 sheets stacked up.  If there's any overlap, let it go up the sides of the dish.",
      "7. Dump in all the spinach-egg mixture and spread it out flat.  Top this with a sheet of phyllo, butter as before, and continue until you've used up the rest of the phyllo.",
      "8. It's best to refrigerate the assembled spanakopita for at least an hour before you bake it.  If you can't, it's no big deal, but you'll definitely want to score the top (and refrigeration makes this easier).  If you don't score it, you run the risk of shredding your top crust when it comes time to cut and serve.  I like to score mine in diamond shapes.",
      "9. Bake at 400 degrees F (180 C) for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the top is brown.  Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving."

      "To make candy bacon:Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Arrange bacon strips in large rimmed baking pan. Bake until browned, about 15 minutes. Pour off bacon fat. Brush bacon with half of syrup. Bake until glazed, about 3 minutes. Flip bacon over, brush other side, and bake until glazed, 3 minutes more.Immediately transfer bacon to a plate to cool completely (bacon crisp when cooled).Coarsely chop the bacon. (Bacon can be prepared up to 2 hours ahead; do not refrigerate.) ",
      " To make the tart crust: Lightly butter a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. In medium bowl, add flour, brown sugar and salt and stir to combine. Add butter. Using pastry blender or two knives, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal.Stir in beaten egg to make soft dough. Firmly and evenly press dough into tart pan. Freeze for 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Place tart on baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven.Keep oven on. ",
      " To make the filling: Drain sweet potatoes, reserving 1/4 cup syrup. Using food processor, process sweet potatoes until mashed. Add brown sugar, yogurt, flour, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves and pulse to combine. Add milk and egg whites and process, scraping down sides of bowl, until smooth. Pour into crust. ",
      " Bake for 10 minutes at 400 degrees F. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake until filling is lightly and evenly puffed and jiggles as a unit when pan is shaken lightly, 45 to 50 minutes. Transfer to wire rack and cool completely. (The tart can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day.) ",
      " To make caramel sauce: In medium heavy saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring to boil over high heat, stirring constantly. When boiling, stop stirring and cook, occasionally swirling the pan by its handle and washing down any crystals on the sides with a bristle brush dipped in water, until syrup is smoking and the color of an old penny, 3 to 5 minutes. You will not need a candy thermometer—judge the caramel by its color. Reduce heat to low. Carefully and slowly stir in warm cream (it will foam up) and mix until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and salt.Let cool.Makes about 3/4 cup sauce.(The sauce can be cooled, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 day.Reheat before serving.) ",
      " To serve: Remove tart pan sides. Cut into wedges, spoon sauce over each serving and sprinkle with chopped candy bacon. "

      "Attach the KitchenAid® Sifter + Scale Attachment to your KitchenAid® mixer fitted with the flat beater. Place the scale lid on top. Weigh the butter (1/2 cup + 7 Tbs = 7 oz total), cut it into small cubes, place it into a small bowl and refrigerate it while you weigh and prepare the other ingredients.",
      "With the ingredient valve in the closed position, weigh the flour (7.4 oz), cornmeal (1 oz), salt (0.08 oz), and sugar (0.08 oz) in the ingredient hopper, taring the scale between ingredients. Turn the mixer to low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift the flour mixture into the mixing bowl. Stop the mixer and scatter the ice-cold butter over top. Mix on medium-low speed until the butter is the size of peas, about 3 minutes. Pour the water in a slow steady stream. Stop the mixer once to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix 20 seconds longer to incorporate any scraggly bits.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a sheet of parchment paper. Sprinkle the parchment with flour. Gather the dough and flatten it to form a thick disk. Sprinkle flour over top. Place the second sheet of parchment over top. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough to form a 1/4-in-/6-mm-thick circle about 13 1/2-in/34-cm wide. Place the dough, still between the parchment sheets, on a flat, wide baking sheet and refrigerate until cold, 30 to 60 minutes.",

      "While the dough is chilling, make the filling. Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Trim the ends, scoop out the seeds and pulp, and discard. (The skin of Delicata squash is tender and delicious to eat when roasted.) Cut the squash crosswise into 1/4-in-/6-mm-thick slices. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the apple slices, garlic, thyme, olive oil, vinegar, pepper, and 1 tsp salt. Toss to combine. Spread out on a large, rimmed baking sheet lined with a sheet of parchment paper. Roast until the squash is fork tender and the edges are caramelized, about 20 minutes, stirring once or twice while baking. Let the filling cool to room temperature before filling the galette.",
      "To assemble the galette, lift off the top sheet of parchment and center the rolled out dough, still with the bottom sheet of parchment in place, on a large rimmed baking sheet. (The edges of the dough will overhang on two sides of the pan; and that is OK.) Scatter half of the goat cheese on the dough, leaving a 2-in/5-cm border. Mound the filling evenly over top, also leaving a border. Scatter the remaining goat cheese over top. Fold the border of the dough over the filling, pleating the dough to form a rustic tart. (The center is open and not covered with dough.) Pinch to seal any cracks at the edges. Brush the dough with the heavy cream. Sprinkle the dough with ground pepper and flake sea salt.",
      "Place the tart in the center of the oven and bake until the crust is deeply golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve warm. The galette can be made several hours in advance, kept at room temperature, and rewarmed just before serving. The galette is best when served on the day it is baked. Leftovers can be covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days. Rewarm before serving."

      "Make the pastry dough. Place the flour, 2 teaspoons of sugar, salt and cold butter cubes into your KitchenAid® Stand Mixer fitted with the flat beater, and turn to speed 4. Mix the ingredients for 2-3 minutes, or until the butter is most broken down to pea-sized bits. With mixer on speed 2, drizzle the ice water in a slow, steady stream (in less than 15 seconds). When water is all added, immediately turn off the mixer, remove the bowl and gather the dough into your hands, gently kneading until the dough is smooth and no longer crumbly, but being careful not to overwork it. (You should see flecks of butter throughout.) Form into a disc, wrap in plastic, and place in the freezer to chill (at least 15 minutes) while you prepare the filling. (Place the baking sheet you’ll be baking on into the freezer to chill, as well.)",
      "Make the apple noodles: Attach the Vegetable Sheet Cutter Attachment to your KitchenAid® Stand Mixer. Insert food holder into the center of one end of the apple and secure onto attachment. Insert food skewer through the apple, up to the first mark. Attach Noodle Blade and position a medium bowl under the blade to catch apple noodles. Turn Stand Mixer to Speed 2 and slowly position the blade against the apple to process. Once processed, pick out as much of the peel as you can without breaking the noodles. (You can pinch the ends of the noodles to break off the peel pieces, too.) Discard the peels and the cores. Drizzle the juice of 1 lemon over the bowl of apple noodles, and gently toss to evenly coat the apples in the juice. Then, mix the remaining 2 teaspoons of sugar with the cinnamon, and toss the apples in the sugar mixture. Set aside.",
      "Make the filling: Remove the Sheet Cutter Attachment from your stand mixer, attach the wire whip, and then whip together the cream cheese, 1/2 cup of white sugar, sour cream and egg. Set aside. (If not working on assembly immediately, put the filling in the refrigerator until ready to use.)",
      "Assemble the galette:\tRemove the chilled dough from the freezer and roll into a rough circle approximately 12”-14” in diameter, and about 1/4” thick. Gently place the disc of dough onto the chilled baking sheet, allowing sides to overhang the sheet. Carefully pour/spread the cream cheese mixture around the center of the disc being sure to leave an edge of approximately 2”. Working from center, begin with the longest apple noodles and, starting with a tight spiral at the center, twirl the noodles into a larger and larger spiral as you work towards the edge of the filling. Continue to spiral the noodles around each other, being careful not to press the noodles too deep into the filling; and, extend the spiral pattern as close to the edge of the cheese filling as possible. Once your longest noodles are used, begin incorporating the shorter noodle strands into the spiral design to give depth and texture. Then, for the smallest apple shreds, spread them evenly along the edge of the spiral design/cheese mixture where they’ll be covered by the dough when dough is folded up.",
      "Fold the 2” border of the dough over the filling, gently overlapping each fold and pleating/pinching the edges as you move until the entire edge is ‘wrapped’ in dough. Pinch to seal any cracks at the edges. Brush all exposed dough with egg wash and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of white sugar; then, sprinkle the apples with a few shakes of cinnamon. Return galette to freezer for at least 15 minutes before baking.",
      "Bake in preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. Allow to cool for 10 minutes prior to slicing."

When you see bubbles, add onion, celery, carrot, shallot, salt/pepper, herbs of choice and cayenne. When they begin to soften, add a small amount of broth, mix and place the lid on top for 10-15 minutes or until veggies are soft. Add the chicken and enough chicken broth to cover. I added more briquettes to the bottom and a few on the lid at this point to really heat things up. Allow this to reduce a bit and heat the chicken, then you might need to add some flour to thicken, stirring it in the entire time. Make dumplings in a bowl until you have a chunky mix and plop them over the chicken mix, 6 to 8 dumplings. Place lid back on and cook 10-15 minutes or until the dough is cooked through. Ta-da!",

Cook until veggies are soft, then add some broth and reduce 5 or so minutes. Toss in the chicken pieces and more broth, just to cover the chicken and place lid on for about 5-10 minutes. Stir in flour to thicken and make dumpling mix. Plop the dumplings, 6 to 8 on the mix and cover again for 15-20 minutes or until the dough is cooked through."

      "Place the eggs in the bowl of your KitchenAid® Stand Mixer fitted with the wire whip. Attach the KitchenAid® Sifter + Scale Attachment to your mixer. Close the ingredient valve. Weigh the sugar in the ingredient hopper. Turn the mixer to high speed and whip the eggs for 1 minute. Open the ingredient valve, and sift the sugar into the mixing bowl. Beat the eggs and sugar until the mixture turns thick and pale yellow, and the mixture falls in ribbons from the whip, about 8 to 10 minutes. About 5 minutes into the mixing time, slowly pour the vanilla down the side of the bowl.",
      "Meanwhile, close the ingredient valve and weigh the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt in the ingredient hopper, taring the scale between ingredients. Once the eggs have reached the ribbon stage, turn the mixer to low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift in the flour mixture. Be careful not to overmix the batter. Remove the mixer bowl, and use a rubber spatula to blend in any flour remaining on the sides of the bowl. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the melted butter mixture, just until combined.",
      "Gently pour the batter into the prepared tube pan. Bake the cake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let the cake cool in the pan. Once the cake is completely cool, run a table knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cake, including the inner tube. Carefully lift up the tube to release the cake from the sides of the pan. Run a table knife around the bottom to release the cake. Lift the cake straight up, off the tube, and transfer the cake to a wire rack set over a baking sheet.",
      "While the cake is cooling, prepare the glaze. In a medium metal or heatproof bowl, combine the chocolate, cream, corn syrup, espresso powder, and salt. Place the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water and heat, stirring frequently, until the chocolate mixture is smooth and shiny. Remove from the heat.",
      "To glaze the cake, evenly pour the glaze over the cake and then use a small offset spatula to spread the glaze evenly over the top of the cake, spreading it out to the edges. Use all of the glaze. Lift the cake still on the wire rack and tap the wire rack down on the baking sheet several times, allowing the glaze to naturally flow down the sides of the cake. Set aside for 30 minutes to allow the glaze to set. Transfer the cake to a cake plate, cut into wedges and serve. The cake is best when served on the day it is baked. Store the cake for up to 2 days in a covered cake box at room temperature."

Bake the fruitcake until the top is deeply golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Set the cake on a wire rack.

Increase the mixer to medium, and beat until smooth, stopping the mixer once to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Use a rubber spatula to incorporate any remaining bits of confectioners’ sugar.",
      "To finish the cake, run a table knife around the inside edge of the pan to loosen the cake. Invert the cake onto a wire rack, peel off the parchment paper, and then turn the cake right side up. Place the cake on a wire rack with a baking sheet underneath to catch any drips. Pour the glaze over the cake, and use a small offset spatula to gently push the glaze evenly to the edges so it drips down the sides of the cake. Allow the glaze to set before transferring the cake to a cake plate. Cut into wedges when ready to serve. The cake can be made up to 2 days in advance. Store the cake for up to one week in a covered cake box at room temperature. "

If you don't have a bread maker, mix the ingredients by hand, cover and let rise in a warm place for a couple of hours. Roll out the dough into two rectangles (each rectangle, a small loaf), in the central part put slices of Brie and spread with the compote. Roll the loaf of bread and arrange in a baking tray lined with parchment paper (I used a baguette mold) with the closure facing down. Let rise for another hour and a half. Preheat the oven to 190 °. With a razor blade make transversal cuts on the loaves and bake for about 20 minutes (or until golden brown). Serve hot bread, excellent cut into slices and spend a couple of minutes under the grill."

Add the onion along with the next 4 ingredients, ½ teaspoon of salt and a couple cracks of pepper. Cook for 6-7 minutes, sitting often, until the onions soften up a little bit. Add the bourbon and cook until almost all of it has evaporated, about 1 minute. Add the maple syrup and chicken stock, bring to a simmer, and cook until the mixture has reduced by half. Add 1 teaspoon of vinegar and give the glaze a taste, it will most likely need another ¼ salt and possibly 1 more teaspoon of vinegar. You want the flavors to be sweet, spicy, and tangy. Take off the heat and strain the glaze through a mesh strainer, put aside. ",

Sear the pork chops on one side for 2 minutes, flip and transfer the entire pan to the oven for 10-12 minutes. If using a probe thermometer, pull the chops when they reach 155 degrees F. ",
      " While the chops are cooking, make the apple and fennel slaw by using a hand slicer or mandolin to cut the fennel and apple into match stick size pieces, julienne. Add them to a bowl along with the remaining slaw ingredients and mix well. Taste for seasoning, you may need a squeeze of lemon juice or a pinch more salt. ",
      " When the chops are ready, let them rest for 3 minutes before serving. Drizzle some maple glaze all over the chops and serve with the slaw. Enjoy! "

Add the marinated chicken and stir-fry until no longer pink, for about 3 to 5 minutes.",

Sprinkle on and mix in the peanuts and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate, garnish with more scallions and peanuts if desired and serve with rice and enjoy!"

Add enough water to just barely cover the ribs and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 2 hours until tender. Pull the ribs from the braising liquid and cool completely  ",

Bring the mixture to a boil and continue to cook until deeply caramelized, watching carefully towards the end of cooking to avoid scorching. Remove the pot from the heat and add the young coconut juice – careful the mixture may sputter. Whisk to combine and season with fish sauce and lime juice. Taste and re-season as needed ",

Heat a wok and when wisps of smoke begin to appear, place one batch of ribs (approximately 3 cups) into the wok with a small amount of caramel sauce. Toss to coat fully. Repeat with the remaining batches of ribs "

      "Place the brown sugar in the bowl of your KitchenAid® Stand Mixer fitted with the dough hook. Attach the KitchenAid® Sifter + Scale Attachment to your mixer. With the ingredient valve in the closed position, weigh the bread flour, semolina flour, salt, and yeast in the ingredient hopper, taring the scale between ingredients. Turn the mixer to medium-low speed, open the ingredient valve, and sift the flour mixture into the mixing bowl. Turn the mixer off.",
      "Combine the water and 2 tablespoons (30-ml/1-oz) of the olive oil.",
      "With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour the water mixture into the dry ingredients. As the flour gets absorbed, turn the mixer to medium-low and knead the dough until it looks sticky and shaggy, 1 to 2 minutes. Make sure all the water is incorporated into the flour mixture, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, if needed. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Transfer the dough to a medium bowl brushed with olive oil. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap, drape a clean dish towel over top and set the bowl aside. Let the dough rest at room temperature (about 70ºF/21ºC) for 18 to 24 hours. The dough is ready when the surface is dotted with bubbles.",
      "Generously brush a sheet of parchment paper with 1 tablespoon (15-ml/0.5-oz) of the olive oil. Dust the parchment with semolina flour. Dump the dough out onto the parchment sheet. Try to coax it out of the mixing bowl in one piece, using a rubber spatula, if needed. Using your hands, dusted with semolina flour, pull the perimeter of the dough ball towards the center and pinch it together. (The dough will be very sticky; use a light touch.) Without deflating the dough, flip the dough over so the smooth side is up. Lift up the parchment paper, with the dough in the center, and transfer it to a wide, medium-sized mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and drape a clean dish towel over top. Let it rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, to give it time to rise a bit more.",
      "One hour before baking the bread, position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 475ºF/240ºC/gas 9. Set the cast-iron or enameled cast-iron pot with lid in the oven while the oven preheats.",
      "When the dough is ready, carefully remove the heated pot from the oven. Working quickly, uncover the dough, use the point of a sharp knife to make a slash across the top of the dough ball. Carefully, lift the lid off the heated pot, and then pick up the parchment with the dough in the center and place it in the pot. Wearing oven mitts or using a heatproof spatula, push any excess paper towards the sides. Place the lid on top, with any excess paper remaining inside the pot. Bake the bread for 35 to 45 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer registers between 200ºF to 205ºF/93ºC to 96ºC when inserted into the center of the loaf. The bread should be evenly golden and the bottom and sides nicely browned. Turn the bread out onto a wire rack, remove the parchment, flip the bread right side up, and let cool.",
      "While the bread is still hot but cooling, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons (30-ml/1-oz) of olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add a small sprig of rosemary and let the oil infuse for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside for 5 minutes. Brush the top of the loaf with the olive oil and then sprinkle generously with flake sea salt. Let the loaf cool for at least an hour before slicing."

Steam the lobsters for 8 minutes, and crack the shells slightly to allow the smoke to more easily penetrate the lobster flesh.  I use a small electric smoker.  In a disposable aluminum pan, spread the brown sugar and top with the tea leaves.  Turn on the smoker and place the lobsters on a rack over the tea and sugar.  The brown sugar dissolves and burns the tea leaves and creates a delicious smoke.  When the smoke is evident, turn off the smoker and let the lobster sit in the smokey environment for 10 minutes-no longer, because you don't want the smoke to overwhelm the delicate lobster.  Pick the lobster meat and cut into bite sized chunks-can be made a day ahead and chilled until needed."

      "Attach Vegetable Sheet Cutter Attachment to your KitchenAid® Stand Mixer. Insert the food holder into the center of one end of the potato and secure onto attachment. Insert the food skewer through potato, up to the first mark. Attach Noodle Blade to attachment and position a medium bowl under the blade to catch potato noodles. Turn Stand Mixer to Speed 2 and slowly position the blade against the potato to process. Repeat with remaining potatoes. Rinse the potato noodles in cool water to remove starch, then gently lay the potato noodles on a dry kitchen towel (or paper towels) and blot to remove excess water. (If you prefer no skins in your hasbrowns, remove as many of the skins from the noodles as possible.)\t\t\t\t\t",
      "Place another large bowl below the blade and process the zucchini and yellow squash in the same way as the potato. Trim the noodles to 10”-12” lengths; then, sprinkle salt and pepper over the squash noodles, add parsley, and drizzle 2 tablespoons of melted butter over the mixture. Using tongs, toss the noodles until all are evenly coated in butter. Set aside.\t\t\t\t\t\t",
      "Heat a 12” high sided saucepan on medium high heat and add 1 tablespoon olive oil to hot pan. Add diced red pepper and garlic to pan and sauté, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes, just to soften. Pour squash noodle mixture into hot pan, and sauté noodles until they begin to soften, about 4 minutes, while stirring. Remove noodle sauté from pan and set aside.\t\t\t\t\t\t",
      "With pan still on medium high heat, add 3 tablespoons of butter and toss in the potato noodles. Stir the potato noodles around in the pan to evenly coat them in butter, then allow them to sit undisturbed and fry for 4-5 minutes, occasionally pressing down on the potatoes with a spatula. Gently flip the potatoes, and remaining 3 tablespoons of butter (spread little pats around the pan and under the potatoes). Then, with two forks, evenly separate the potatoes and gather them into four ‘nest’ layers, one nest in each quadrant of the pan.",
      "On top of each potato ‘nest’, layer 1/4 of the squash sauté, twirling the noodles as you layer to create a real ‘nest’ look. (Add any remaining red peppers and parsley around the nests.) Then, create a wide well (almost the complete width of the nest, but no deeper than the top of the potato layer) at the center of each squash layer, and crack an egg into the well. Gently ‘nest’ the eggs with a fork to slightly thin the whites (for ease of cooking), but without cracking the yolk. Reduce heat of the pan to medium, cover the pan, and allow the eggs to steam and potato base to fry for for 4-5 minutes (or until egg is cooked to desired doneness). Using a spatula, gently release each nest from the bottom of the pan and serve immediately."

(Pro Tip: Shop at an Asian market or grocery store with a service butcher counter for very thinly sliced beef about 1/10-inch thick. It may be labeled as sukiyaki or beef for hotpot. Applesauce helps tenderize the meat. )",

Repeat cooking with spinach, using remaining oil, mirin, salt, and soy sauce; adding one-third of spinach at a time (pan will be very full); and turning with tongs until spinach wilts, 5-10 minutes total. Transfer spinach to a bowl and cover. Set vegetables aside.",

Quickly fluff cooked rice with a fork, then add to pan, pressing it in for maximum contact over the bottom and 1 inch up the side. Let rice cook undisturbed until it starts to crisp up and turns golden underneath (lift to check), 8-10 minutes.  ",

Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining oil and beef. (Pro Tip: To brown meat, not steam it, make sure the pan is quite hot before adding beef, and cook the meat in batches so the pan isn't overcrowded. You don't need much oil in the pan since the marinade includes oil.)",
