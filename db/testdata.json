      " To make the tart crust: Lightly butter a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. In medium bowl, add flour, brown sugar and salt and stir to combine. Add butter. Using pastry blender or two knives, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse meal.Stir in beaten egg to make soft dough. Firmly and evenly press dough into tart pan. Freeze for 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Place tart on baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven.Keep oven on. ",
      " To make the filling: Drain sweet potatoes, reserving 1/4 cup syrup. Using food processor, process sweet potatoes until mashed. Add brown sugar, yogurt, flour, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves and pulse to combine. Add milk and egg whites and process, scraping down sides of bowl, until smooth. Pour into crust. ",
      " Bake for 10 minutes at 400 degrees F. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake until filling is lightly and evenly puffed and jiggles as a unit when pan is shaken lightly, 45 to 50 minutes. Transfer to wire rack and cool completely. (The tart can be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day.) ",
      " To make caramel sauce: In medium heavy saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring to boil over high heat, stirring constantly. When boiling, stop stirring and cook, occasionally swirling the pan by its handle and washing down any crystals on the sides with a bristle brush dipped in water, until syrup is smoking and the color of an old penny, 3 to 5 minutes. You will not need a candy thermometer—judge the caramel by its color. Reduce heat to low. Carefully and slowly stir in warm cream (it will foam up) and mix until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and salt.Let cool.Makes about 3/4 cup sauce.(The sauce can be cooled, covered, and refrigerated for up to 1 day.Reheat before serving.) ",
      " To serve: Remove tart pan sides. Cut into wedges, spoon sauce over each serving and sprinkle with chopped candy bacon. "
